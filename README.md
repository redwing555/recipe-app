# Ruby on Rails Blog App

This is the first project I have built using Ruby on Rails.

It's meant to be a simple blog app that I can use to learn new technologies.
## Built With

- Ruby on Rails

## Getting Started


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the `bundle install` command
3. Run `rails s` to start the server
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the blog posts

### Prerequisites

- You need to have Ruby installed on your machine.


### Installation

- First, you will need to clone this repository into your local machine.

- Second, you need to create the database for this app. In order to do this, you can do `rails db:create`, then do `rails db:migrate`.

- Third, if you want to add your own comments or posts, you can delete the ones that are done by default on `post.rb` and `comment.rb` and create your own.
### Run tests

- To run the test all you need to do is do `cd` to the correct folder and run `rspec`, or you can do `rspec spec/` to run all the tests.
